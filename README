Here is a sample README.md file for the code:


# Scripture Search API

Scripture Search API is a Golang web API for searching the bible (KJV version) by verse or chapter. It allows users to search for verses in KJV Bible by providing a query string parameter.


## Installation and Usage


1. Clone the repository
2. Create a .env file and configure environment variables. (Please reference the .env.example file)
3. Run go run main.go to start the server
4. To search a bible verse, make a GET request to http://localhost:8080/search?query=[your search query]. This will return a JSON response with an array of matches, sorted by the most similar match.

### API Endpoints


`/`  (Returns a simple JSON response of "{'message': 'Hello World'}")

`/search` (Takes in a query parameter for search and returns a JSON response of matching verses)

### Dependencies


- gorilla/mux
- joho/godotenv
- rs/cors


### Embeddings
- The word embeddings are taken from Bible-Embeddings




### CORS Configuration
- The API is restricted to only allow GET requests and allows all headers and origins. You can modify these settings as needed in the code.
